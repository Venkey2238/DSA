# DSA
This repository consists of some problem solving question and DSA questions 

I am uploading the folders of my problems directly from the **intellij** if you download this editor you can easily run the programs directly. If not you have to make sum adjustments in the code 
And am using the **JAVA** to code So feel free to point out any mistakes and the optimization techiques in the problems *Hope you like my code*.
